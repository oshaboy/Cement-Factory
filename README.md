# Cement Factory
 This is a game about working in a very not OSHA compliant Cement Factory
## Controls
 Use 7 to move left, 8 to move right and E to pull the levers. 
 You can also use 4, 5 and D if you're more comfortable with that. 
 If you fall off, go overboard or overflow one of the containers you lose a life. 
## Scoring
 A score is displayed at the end of the game because I only have 64x32 pixels to work with here. 
 1 point for moving the cement between containers. 2 points for moving it into the truck. 

## About
 I half completed this game years ago and finally got the motivation to finish it. Compile it using c8asm. I recommend playing it on [Cadmium](https://github.com/gulrak/cadmium) but there are so many Chip-8 emulators out there.
